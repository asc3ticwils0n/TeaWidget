Reviewer 1 Peer assessment of assignment 3

I've tested the code on titanium and it seems to be working, but the first issue 
I see is that I don't see a navigation window in your code (Note- actually I read 
your code later today how how you created a newWin variable so that should count as 
navigation, but in your tilt.js file there doesn't seem to be code to go back to the 
other window). A solution for that issue would simply create another button something 
like this listed below and you should be good to go.

NavButton2.addEventListener('click', function() {
	Ti.API.info('Clicked Home Button');
	win2.close();
});

From titanium there doesn't seem to be any errors appearing and all of your colors 
and case buttons are there too so that's a good job. You're using the accelerometer 
from page 158, chapter 7, but when I tried using it in titanium by hitting the accelerometer 
button I would be able to go there, but when I try to tilt my computer it wouldn't do anything. 
Overall it's good work, but you need to fix the navigation window and then you're all set.
